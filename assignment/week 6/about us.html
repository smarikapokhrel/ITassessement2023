   			<h1>The british college </h1>
 				Founded in 2011, The British College offers world-class education for aspiring students in Nepal to gain internationally-recognised qualifications from their two partner British Universities: the University of the West of England (UWE) and Leeds Beckett University (LBU). 

				<br>
We have successfully established a distinctive identity as the pioneering global college in Nepal and offer reputed UK degrees and courses that are relevant to the current job market, and enhance the employability of each and every student.
			<br>
Our aim is to provide students with a global learning experience and worldwide opportunities. We are further defined by our local-to-global approach in the provision of our degrees and courses which are staffed by tutors and administrative personnel from the UK and Nepal. In this way, the College provides premium education that compels students and staff to be globally-minded - a notion which is further encouraged by the multinational companies involved in our student exchange programmes and internships.
			<br>
We also believe that supporting and interacting with the local community is an integral part of student life, and we are committed to achieving excellence in our research and upholding the highest standards of integrity.
